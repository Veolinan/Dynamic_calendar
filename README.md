# Dynamic_calendar
Dynamic Calendar in HTML CSS & JavaScript.
In my dynamic calendar, users can see the current date and day.
They can also see the days of the present, past, or future month using the previous and next icons. 
All these are done with Vanilla JavaScript which means no external library is used to create this calendar.
